Hello, my name is Wijdan Khaled and I am 22.
I studied computer science at Al-Balqa Applied University.
 I recently graduated from it. When I graduated,
 I applied to many companies, but I did not accept any of them.
I know that it seems normal not to be hired immediately 
after graduation, and I need to be patient,
 but in this area of ​​programming, you need to prove yourself from 
the begining
so I thought what I should do.


 I must develoap and improve myself , 
and this is what I found in this course
I really enjoy it  and hope to complete it successfully 

fun fact about me i sleepe alot and drinke coffe before
 going to sleep 
 note:
 Things that make me happy cats and coffee I have a cat named Cady

 In my spare time I like to watch movies and learn a new language. I am learning Spanish now
